# modify_notebook_metadata

Modify the metadata of all markdown or code cells in a ipynb file so that they may (or may not) be editable or deletable. Also provide a "restore" so that cells are reset to have no metadata.

The modifications may be made to all ipynb files in a folder or to only the ipynb file(s) selected.

Prior to modifying the ipynb files a backup folder is created and files to be modified are copied to this folder.
